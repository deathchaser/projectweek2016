i give some advice each year in my annual sphinx tutorial at pycon
a grateful student asked where i myself had learned the tip i have 
done some archæology and finally have an answer let me
share what i teach them about   semantic linefeeds   
then i will reveal its source    which turns out to have been written 
when i was only a few months old 
in the tutorial  i ask students whether or not the sphinx text files in their project 
will be read by end users if not  then i encourage students to treat the files as private 
source code  that they are free to format semantically instead of fussing 
with the lines of each paragraph so that they all end near the right margin  
they can add linefeeds anywhere that there is a break between ideas
the result can be spectacular
by starting a new line at the end of each sentence
and splitting sentences themselves at natural breaks between
clauses  a text file becomes far easier to edit and version control text 
editors are very good at manipulating lines    so when each sentence is a contiguous 
block of lines  your editor suddenly becomes a very powerful 
mechanism for quickly rearranging clauses and ideas
and your version control system will love semantic linefeeds have 
you ever changed a few words at the beginning of a 
paragraph  only to discover that version control now 
thinks the whole text has changed 
  semantic linefeeds   as i call them  have been making my 
life easier for more than twenty years  and have governed how my text
files look behind the scenes whether my markup format is
html  tex  rst  or the venerable troff macro typesetter
so where did i learn the trick 
for a long time i believed that my source must have been the 
unix documenter s workbench manual the workbench was an attempt
by at&t to market the operating system that had become such a cult
hit internally among bell labs engineers  by bundling the system with 
its most powerful typesetting tools the attempt failed  of course    i 
am told that at&t was terrible at marketing computers  just as xerox had 
no idea what to do with the ideas that were bubbling at parc in the 1970s 
but my father worked at bell labs and had a copy of the workbench documentation
around the house  i cannot find a copy on the internet    were all public copies 
destroyed during the devastating copyright battle that justly brought sco to its ruin  
but after an extensive search  i have found an earlier source    and i could not be
any happier to discover that my inspiration is none other than brian w kernighan 
he published   unix for beginners   pdf  as bell labs technical memorandum 
74 1273 18 on 29 october 1974 it describes a far more primitive version of 
the operating system than his more famous and more widely available   unix for
beginners    second edition  from 1978 after a long search i have found the lone 
copy linked above  hosted on an obscure japanese web page about unix 6th edition
in the section   hints for preparing documents  kernighan shares this wisdom:
hints for preparing documents
most documents go through several versions  always more than you expected  
before they are finally finished accordingly  you should do whatever possible 
to make the job of changing them easy
first  when you do the purely mechanical operations of typing  type so subsequent 
editing will be easy start each sentence on a new line make lines short  and break
 lines at natural places  such as after commas and semicolons  rather than randomly 
since most people change documents by rewriting phrases and adding  deleting and
rearranging sentences  these precautions simplify any editing you have to do later
brian w kernighan  1974
note how pythonic his advice sounds    he replaces the fiction of   write once  
documents with a realistic focus on making text that is easy to edit later 
i must have read this when i was first learning unix and somehow carried it 
with me all of these years it says something very powerful about the unix plain text
approach that advice given in 1974  and basically targeted at making text easier
to edit in the terribly cramped ed text editor  applies just as well to our
modern world of colorful full screen editors like emacs and vim and distributed 
version control systems that were not even imagined in the 1970s
if you are interested in more early unix documentation    including
the second edition of kernighan s   beginners  guide    check out the 7th 
edition manuals which bell labs has kindly made available online  both as pdf
files and also as plain text files marked up for the troff typesetter note that
you can still compile the troff files successfully on a modern system  try
that with any other richly formatted text from the 1970s
